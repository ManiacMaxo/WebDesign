                <p>
                    First off it's pronounced "buh-goon" and we've a bunch of
                    16-17 year olds from Bulgaria who love playing PVP games
                    mostly on ps4 but now on PC as well. The clan was first
                    created for Destiny 1 when everyone loved the game, but as
                    time went on no one really stuck around, however the time
                    for Destiny 2 came around and Bungie descided to create a
                    reward system for clans so the gang was back together. The
                    first year of Destiny 2 was some of the best time for this
                    clan, but the PVP was not what it used to be, ultimately
                    everyone stopped playing that as well.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Rainbow Six Siege was the game to bring back hope for the
                    clan. When everyone got it, Dark was the first to start
                    playing competitively as always, and soon after the rest
                    followed. The first few months were chill as no one knew
                    really how to play and only admired the pros. Dark and
                    ManiacMaxo started duo queueing to reach that diamond rank,
                    but school and M&K cheaters would not allow that. They
                    peaked at low Platinum 2.
                </p>
                <p>
                    From the good old days of Black Ops 3 custom games to
                    evolving into actual professionals, the Bagun clan has come
                    a long way. Now only 4 of the original 13 play regularly but
                    some others have also joined.
